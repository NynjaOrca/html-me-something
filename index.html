          <p>Link was born into the world by the master behind The Legend of Zelda, Shigeru Miyamoto, February 21, 1986.
             As long as I can remember, this character has held a very special place in memory for me. After every character
             I've ever picked in any Super Smash Brothers game, this one stands out to be my very best. Every. Single. Time.
             The projectile play keeps the enemy on guard almost always while you inch closer for deadly smash attacks against them.
             The more they run the better. Just keep stacking the damage with well timed and well placed projectiles.</p>

          <p>Mario is just another fascinating character by the great Shigeru Miyomoto, July 9, 1981. (He creates the most lovable 
             characters I swear). Mario is pretty quick on his feet and loves that aerial gameplay, which makes him not only
             SUPER fun to play but also a very versatile character when used properly. His aerial left/right smash attack is a brutal
             mega fist that sends opponents straight down. If there isn't any land for them to bounce off of, they will certainly
             die. However, if there is land to bounce off of, you get more chances to stack the damage! ^_^</p>

      <a name="shulk"></a>
      <h2>Shulk</h2>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/us/characters/shulk.html">Super Smash Brothers</a></figcaption>
          <p>Shulk is the brainchild of another impressive videogame designer, Tetsuya Takahashi. Shulk made his debut in the Xeno series
             in 2010. Honestly, I had never heard of the name until about two years ago when I first ran across him on SSBWiiU. His character
             is very easy to play though. They try to balance him with a light weight and heavy attacks but most of his style boils down to
             how well you can rad your opponent. This makes him very useful in solo-play mode because the AI is obviously going to be easier
             to predict than another human player. Though I have had a ton of success with him against human players as well as CPUs. His strength
	     lies in not only your ability to read your opponent but also to time your buffs and keep them going constantly. DO NOT FIGHT IN THE AIR.</p>

          <p>ANOTHER great character by Shigeru Miyomoto! Debut: 1985 with Super Mario Bros. He's the King of the Koopas and in Japan he bears
             The title of Daimao (Great Demon King). For some reason I've been unreasonably good with this character since the beginning of my
             Smash Brothers days. He's SUPER slow and SUPER heavy but he deals a lot of damage. Also, if you link a lot of his attacks that have
             shorter cooldown times, he becomes dangerously mobile. Not to mention he can suicide while bringing you with him. This makes him a 
             "clutch" player. A character you choose in order to set the record straight when there isn't a thing else you've tried that works.
             I mostly use him because it's fun to watch everyone put little tick marks in my MASSIVE shell with their puny attacks though.</p>

      <h2>Megaman</h2>

          <img src="images/Megaman.png" alt="Megaman">
          <figcaption>Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/us/characters/mega_man.html">Super Smash Brothers</a></figcaption>
          <p>Megaman (originally named "Rock") was created by Capcom back in 1987. I remember being a kid, sitting in school, and thinking of 
             the fastest way I could reach my Super Nintendo to play Megaman X when I got home. Always had to do dishes or some other necessary
             but very DUMB chore. (Playing a game in a clean environment has always been more comfortable so I guess in hindsight it wasn't so bad.)
             His amount of utility moves matches Link and that's what I love so much about him now. (because it's not hard to find that Megaman
             amazing otherwise!) He's moderately quick and is able to keep firm standing with just about any enemy. That being said, he does have
             a few set backs. His lagtimes on most of his attacks are garbage and he doesn't do a whole lot of damage. I was wishing they would've 
             Zero into the game as well. That would've been so cool!</p>

      <h2>Olimar</h2>

          <p>Olimar(Created by Shigeru Miyomoto in 2001 for the game Pikmin) and I go back as far as just about any other character for me. 
             There have been plenty of rainy days when I would just sit in my room breeding pikmin(the little plant dudes surrounding him) 
             and using them to solve puzzles and fight enemies in all sorts of ways. He's just as fun to play in SSBWiiU as he is in his own
             games if not MORE! Most of his attacks require pikmin which kinda blows but it pays off when you're able to order them correctly
             by using his whistle or geting lucky enough to pluck a good one from the terrain your standing on. Elements get involved and the game
             turns into a fireworks show of damage and opponents fainting! Good times.</p>

      <h2>Ike</h2>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/Ike.png" alt="Ike">
          <figcaption>Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/us/characters/ike.html">Super Smash Brothers</a></figcaption>
          <p>Ike was created by an artist named Senri Kita in 2005 for the game Fire Emblem: Path Of Radiance. I don't know very much about
             the Fire Emblem series because I never really cared for tactical games like this. They move far too slow for my liking. Ike is a
             really well made character though. Like Bowser he's very slow. Even his attacks are slow if you can't find the right combos to stick out.
             There have been a lot of times when I'm playing a fast opponent who can't seem to get around me though. I think most of that is due to his
             attacks' hit ranges and also their penetration. There's almost nothing that can stop Ike's sword once it's flung through the air (you can
             neutralize him completely by simply attacking Ike's own hitbox though) problem with Ike is that I spend too much time trying to get the
             upper hand on the enemy and not enough time trying to find my own ground and sticking to it. No other character seems to affect me in this way.</p>
